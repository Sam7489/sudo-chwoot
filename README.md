## üìå About the Vulnerability

**CVE-2025-32463** is a **local privilege escalation vulnerability** discovered in `sudo`, where the misuse of the `-R` option (used to set a custom root directory) combined with a crafted `nsswitch.conf` file allows arbitrary shared object injection and execution with **root privileges**.

- ‚úÖ Affects: `sudo` versions **1.9.14 ‚Üí 1.9.17**
- ‚ùå Fixed in: `sudo` **1.9.18 and above**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Impact: Local users can escalate privileges and spawn a **root shell**.

## üîç Exploit Behavior

This PoC:
- Creates a malicious **NSS shared library** that grants root access.
- Constructs a fake `nsswitch.conf` file to load the custom NSS module.
- Uses `sudo -R` to execute within a fake root directory that contains the crafted config and library.
- Spawns a **root shell** if successful.
